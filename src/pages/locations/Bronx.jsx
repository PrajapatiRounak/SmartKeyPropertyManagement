                          If you own a rental property in the Bronx, you have to expect the unexpected. A leaking pipe can become water damaged overnight, a delayed repair can lead to frustrated tenants and small maintenance issues can quickly become costly problems if not taken care of in time. Before long, you're managing contractors, fielding maintenance calls and trying to keep everything running while juggling your own schedule. That's a lot for a landlord to handle alone.
